## Nothing Ever Goes According to Plan

Meet **Soltrone** - my ambitious attempt at building a multifunctional drone. The concept seemed straightforward enough: Raspberry Pi 5 + camera. Simple, right?

*Spoiler alert: It wasn't.*

## The Current Setup

I'm using ROS2 as middleware, which feels like the right choice for modular development. The plan was to build each functionality as separate packages - clean, organized, professional.

But here's where reality decided to crash the party: this is my first time soldering. Ever. And let's just say my soldering skills are... well, they exist. Barely.

The result? I accidentally created a bridge between components, which promptly fried some parts. Now I'm waiting for replacement components while trying to push forward with simulation using IsaacSim.

## The Plot Thickens: Technical Dilemmas

### 1. The Vision vs. Reinforcement Learning Debate

This is where things get philosophically interesting. I have a sensor - a regular camera The question is: how do I best utilize this data?

**Option 1: Pre-trained Vision Models**
- Pros: Excellent performance out of the box
- Cons: Integrating depth camera data requires additional work/training

**Option 2: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning**
- Pros: Can train on both camera 
- Cons: Limited scalability for complex vision tasks

Here's my dilemma: I want to start with Option 2 for obstacle avoidance (it makes sense for this use case), but what about owner recognition? Object detection? More sophisticated vision tasks? RL might hit a ceiling there.

It's that classic engineering trade-off again - immediate simplicity vs. long-term flexibility.

### 2. The Feature Creep Problem

The more I think about Soltrone's potential, the more complex it becomes:
- Vision processing
- Small LLM for user interaction
- Multiple mission modes (security, surveillance, escort)
- Hardware constraints
- Battery limitations

Every addition compounds the complexity exponentially.

## The Harsh Reality of Budget Constraints

Let's be brutally honest: **I'm broke.** 

University funding is limited, and my personal budget for this project is... let's call it "creative." This means every component choice becomes a careful balance between cost and performance.

The learning curve has been expensive:
- 5 successful test flights ‚úÖ
- 1 burnt ESC ‚ùå
- 1 potentially defective depth camera ‚ùå
- 1 near-miss with the Raspberry Pi 5 ‚ùå

Each failure is a lesson, but also a financial hit. I need to be more careful, more methodical.

## Current Status and Next Steps

**Where I am now:**
- Waiting for replacement ESC
- Depth camera issues need troubleshooting
- Simulation environment set up in IsaacSim
- Basic control algorithms in development

**What I've learned:**
1. **Hardware debugging is expensive** - both in time and money
2. **Every design decision has cascading effects** - there's no such thing as a simple change
3. **Simulation first, hardware second** - validate everything virtually before touching real components
4. **Budget constraints force creative solutions** - sometimes limitations lead to better designs

## The Path Forward

Soltrone v1 will be conservative by design. I'm focusing on:
- Stable basic control
- Single-sensor obstacle avoidance
- Robust hardware connections (no more soldering disasters!)
- Incremental feature additions

The dream of a fully autonomous, multi-modal AI drone is still there. But I'm learning that the path to that dream is paved with burnt ESCs, budget constraints, and the occasional hardware catastrophe.

## Failures, causes, and fixes

- Burnt ESC: Caused by unintended solder bridge and poor insulation.
  - Fix: Replace ESC, rework solder joints, add heat-shrink/insulation, strain-relief on wires, continuity test before power.
- Depth camera instability: Potential defective unit or power noise.
  - Fix: Validate with separate power source; test USB cable/port; check dmesg logs; try firmware reset; swap unit if unstable persists.
- Feature creep and complexity: Expanding scope increased integration risk.
  - Fix: Freeze v1 scope to stable control + single-sensor avoidance; gate new features behind simulation sign-off.

## Actionable checklist

- Pre-flight hardware checklist: continuity test, insulation check, ESC calibration, propellers off for motor tests.
- Simulation-first: validate new features in IsaacSim; only then move to hardware.
- Budget guardrails: component selection sheet with cost caps; buy spares for high-risk parts (ESCs, props).

*Next update: Hopefully with a working ESC and fewer sparks flying.* ‚ö°

**Status**: v1 scope locked; hardware reworked; simulation-first pipeline in place. üöÅ
