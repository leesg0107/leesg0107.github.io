## Project Overview

I realized that Soltrone v1 was too small for a mission drone. There's a clear tradeoff when building one: if you want to add multiple cameras and fly longer, you need bigger motors and batteries. That's why I decided to move on to v2.

This is just Phase 1 (flying), but it's a good start. This post will serve as a complete drone-building guide for anyone who wants to make their own.

## Essential Components

Here are the components every drone needs:

- **FC (Flight Controller)**
- **ESC** (two options: 4-in-1 or individual ESCs)
- **Motors**
- **Propellers**
- **Battery**
- **Drone frame**
- **Receiver + RC controller**

**Optional:** Camera, GPS—add these based on your purpose.

## Component Selection Guide

### Flight Controller (FC)

Your choice depends on your purpose:

- **Mission drone** → ArduPilot + Mission Planner
- **FPV racing** → Betaflight

Each FC has specialized software for calibration and settings. ArduPilot provides more universal firmware support.

### ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)

There's a tradeoff here. Bigger drones require stronger batteries and more powerful motors, which need better ESCs to handle the load safely.

- **Small drone** → 4-in-1 ESC (compact, simpler wiring)
- **Large drone** → Individual ESCs (better for electrical safety and heat dissipation)

### Motors

I recommend buying motors and ESCs from the same brand as a set. Motors often have specialized ESCs designed for them, and matching them reduces compatibility issues—especially if you have less experience building drones.

### Propellers

This is critical. For a drone to hover stably, diagonal motors must spin in the same direction. One pair spins CW (clockwise), the other CCW (counter-clockwise). Each motor type requires matching props:

- CW motor → CW prop
- CCW motor → CCW prop

Don't mix these up—wrong props will flip your drone instantly.

### Battery

Battery selection depends on your motor and ESC specs. Match the voltage (e.g., 4S, 6S) and ensure the discharge rate (C rating) can handle your motors' current draw.

### Drone Frame

Frames are standardized by the prop size they can accommodate (e.g., 5-inch, 7-inch). Choose a frame that fits your motors and props.

### Receiver + RC Controller

If your goal is an autonomous drone, you don't need a fancy controller—you won't be manually flying most of the time. However, you still need a receiver and controller for hover tests and failsafe. Don't buy expensive ones for this purpose.

## Next Step

Phase 1 is done, but there's a bigger picture here. My goal isn't just to build a drone: it's to create a complete robot system.

Next up: adding 3 stereo cameras (front-left, front-right, and rear) to implement the Semantic VSLAM pipeline I already tested in UE5. This will give the drone spatial awareness and object recognition capabilities.

The long-term vision is distributing complex missions across heterogeneous multi-robot teams. I chose to start with a drone because it's one of the most versatile robots out there; it moves in 3 axes, and it's relatively easy and cheap to build.

I'll keep posting updates as the project progresses. Thanks for reading.
