### Sand-Castle Graph 
    I learned about graphs, a fundamental data structure, in my classes and found them to be incredibly useful.
    In fact, I developed a subway project that identifies transfer stations using graph structures. Graphs are not only
    practical but also have numerous applications across various fields.

    I believe it's crucial to systematically organize and structure your knowledge while clarifying what you understand. 
    Well-established knowledge systems can later interconnect with each other and spark new ideas. This belief led me to 
    develop a mind mapping project that helps organize these knowledge systems effectively. However, I found that conventional 
    mind mapping programs and simple graph structures had limitations when it came to building comprehensive knowledge systems.

    In traditional mind maps, concepts typically flow from one central idea to related concepts. For instance, if we take 
    "reinforcement learning" as the central node, it branches out to concepts like "off policy" and "on policy," which then 
    further extend to more specific topics such as "hierarchical reinforcement learning" or "entropy reinforcement learning." 
    However, a limitation becomes apparent when trying to represent technological evolution, where concepts often build upon 
    previous ones, addressing their limitations in a sequential progression.

    This is where my sand-castle graph comes in. It overcomes these traditional limitations by allowing users to add layer 
    nodes above existing ones when creating mind maps that show sequential development. These layers accumulate like levels 
    in a sandcastle, hence the name.

    I developed this project using Rust, drawing inspiration from the cosmos for its visual theme. Currently, I'm facing a 
    challenge in creating appropriate graphics to represent these layered nodes effectively in Rust. While I'm actively 
    exploring solutions, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or ideas for implementing this visualization component.
