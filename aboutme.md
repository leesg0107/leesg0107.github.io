### who am i 
I'm a very curious person. I like to learn new things.  
The important thing is that live a life which you can enjoy small moments. 
Not every moment can be perfect, but I believe these imperfect moments can make me a stronger person. This is true in reality, and thinking this way also helps me get through tough times more easily. Instead of just focusing on emotions, having this broader perspective allows me to handle challenging moments better.
