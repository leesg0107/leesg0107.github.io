### who am i 
I'm a very curious person. I like to learn new things.  
The important thing is that live a life which you can enjoy small moments. 
Every moment can't be perfect, sometimes you can feel sad or depressed, but always keep in mind that you can find something fun in it. it makes me enjoy my life. 
Therefore i have a lot of things to do. I love to travel, cook, workout and so on. 
My favorite sport is Amercan football. Korea has a very few market of it. 
Me and our team always got stuggle to be better. We even had practice at night without no lights and 
our club room was very small(it's like a 3 by 3 feet room). During this thime, i can learn how to make a good team and what i have to do for the team. The attitude from it makes me lead or make a good team in the future.
