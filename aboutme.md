## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Solgyu Lee

I'm a passionate **junior student** at Soongsil University in Seoul, South Korea, specializing in **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** with a focus on **robotics applications**. 

### ðŸ¤– My Research Focus

My primary interest lies in **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**, particularly its applications in **robotics systems**. I'm fascinated by how multiple intelligent agents can collaborate, compete, and learn from each other to solve complex real-world problems. However, my ultimate goal extends beyond theoretical researchâ€”I aim to become a **well-rounded roboticist** who can bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI algorithms and practical robotic implementations.

### ðŸ”§ From Theory to Practice

While I dive deep into MARL algorithms and neural networks, I believe that understanding the **physical aspects of robotics** is equally crucial. That's why I'm actively involved in:

- **Hardware Projects**: Building robots from scratch to understand mechanical constraints
- **Electronics**: Learning soldering and circuit design for custom robotic components  
- **Systems Integration**: Combining AI software with real robotic hardware

This hands-on approach helps me design more practical and implementable MARL solutions for real-world robotic systems.

### My skills  

| Programming | Frameworks & Tools | Hardware |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Python      | PyTorch           | Soldering |
| Rust        | ROS2              | Robot Assembly |
| C++         | Isaac Sim         |  |
|       | Gazebo            |  |

### ðŸŽ¯ Vision & Goals

I believe the future of robotics lies in **intelligent multi-robot systems** that can:
- Collaborate efficiently in dynamic environments
- Learn and adapt from collective experiences  
- Operate safely alongside humans
- Scale from laboratory settings to real-world applications

My mission is to contribute to this future by developing MARL algorithms that are not just theoretically sound, but also **practically deployable** in real robotic systems.

### ðŸŒŸ Who Am I 

I'm a **curious explorer** driven by the desire to understand how things workâ€”from the mathematical foundations of reinforcement learning to the mechanical intricacies of robotic joints. 

I believe in **learning by doing**. Whether it's implementing a new MARL algorithm or soldering components for a custom robot, I find that hands-on experience provides insights that theory alone cannot offer.

**Life Philosophy**: *Every challenge, whether it's debugging a stubborn RL algorithm or troubleshooting a malfunctioning robot, is an opportunity to grow. I've learned that embracing both successes and setbacks with curiosity rather than frustration leads to deeper understanding and better solutions.*

The intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **physical robotics** excites me because it represents the ultimate challenge: creating machines that can think, learn, and act intelligently in our complex, unpredictable world.
